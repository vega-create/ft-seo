Open Graph protocol lets you control how your web pages appear when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

## Essential OG Tags

Every page should include: og:title (the content title), og:description (a brief summary), og:image (the preview image), og:url (the canonical URL), and og:type (usually website or article).

## Image Requirements

Facebook recommends 1200x630 pixels for optimal display. Images must be at least 200x200 pixels. Keep important content centered since different platforms crop differently. Use high-quality images that represent your content well.

## Testing Your Tags

Use our Open Graph Preview tool to see how your page will appear before publishing. Facebook also provides a sharing debugger that shows exactly how their crawler sees your page.

## Common Mistakes

Using the same image for every page reduces click-through rates. Missing og:image means platforms will pick a random image from your page. Descriptions that are too long get truncated. Not updating tags after content changes leads to outdated previews.

## Platform-Specific Notes

LinkedIn uses OG tags and also supports its own meta tags. Pinterest uses OG tags and also reads Schema.org markup. Twitter primarily uses its own Twitter Card tags but falls back to OG tags if Twitter-specific tags are missing.
