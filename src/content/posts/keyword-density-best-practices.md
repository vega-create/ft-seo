Keyword density measures how often a target keyword appears relative to total word count. While search engines have evolved beyond simple keyword counting, density remains a useful diagnostic tool.

## What Is Keyword Density

Keyword density is calculated as: (keyword count / total words) × 100. If your keyword appears 15 times in a 1000-word article, the density is 1.5%.

## Optimal Density Range

There is no perfect keyword density. However, most SEO experts suggest a primary keyword density between 1-3%. Higher densities can trigger keyword stuffing penalties. Lower densities may not signal relevance strongly enough.

## Beyond Single Keywords

Modern SEO focuses on topic coverage rather than exact keyword repetition. Use variations, synonyms, and related terms naturally throughout your content. Search engines understand semantic relationships between words.

## Using Our Keyword Density Analyzer

Our tool analyzes your content and shows the frequency and density of every significant word. Look for your target keyword in the results and ensure it falls within a natural range. If a word appears too frequently, find opportunities to use synonyms instead.

## Content Quality First

Always write for humans first, then optimize for search engines. Well-written content that thoroughly covers a topic will naturally include relevant keywords at appropriate densities. Forced keyword insertion makes content unreadable and can harm rankings.
