Meta tags tell search engines about your page content. While not all meta tags affect rankings directly, they play a crucial role in how your pages appear in search results.

## Title Tag

The title tag is the most important on-page SEO element. It appears as the clickable headline in search results. Keep titles between 30-60 characters. Include your primary keyword near the beginning. Make each title unique across your site. Our Title Checker helps you optimize length and preview appearance.

## Meta Description

The meta description appears below the title in search results. While not a direct ranking factor, a compelling description improves click-through rate. Keep descriptions between 120-160 characters. Include a call to action. Use your target keyword naturally.

## Open Graph Tags

Open Graph tags control how your page appears when shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms. Include og:title, og:description, og:image, and og:url at minimum. Use our OG Preview tool to see exactly how your page will look when shared.

## Twitter Cards

Twitter Card tags work similarly to Open Graph but are specific to Twitter. Choose between summary and summary_large_image card types. Large image cards tend to get more engagement.

## Canonical Tags

Canonical tags prevent duplicate content issues by telling search engines which version of a page is the original. Use our Canonical URL Builder to generate the correct tags for your pages.
